If all you're interested in is installing this with minimal fuss,
then all you have to do is make sure this project directory is
available at /etc/named/named-privacy, add this line to
relevant view {}s or other relevant zone file locations:

include "/etc/named/named-privacy/named-privacy.conf";

...change the "127.0.0.1." entries in redirects/named.soa to point 
to your local dns server (IF you're using a non-localhost server) 
then reload or restart named. You'll also want to create a cron job 
that performs a "git pull" as your BIND user and does a 
"service named reload" or equivalent periodically if you want to 
have updates automatically applied.

You can also add your own blocks and redirects using the scripts
in blocked/bin and redirects/bin, but be aware that that will
prevent you from being able to auto-update from upstream since
it'll cause your local copy to diverge and make git complain and
refuse to do anything.

Check the tops of the scripts for information on what they do
and how to use them as there isn't any separate documentation
at present.

Once again, make SURE you set up the up the redirects/named.soa
properly or ntp clients with default settings pointing to entries
like 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org WILL fail in strange ways. Alternatively,
comment-out the named.conf.redirects line in named-privacy.conf
