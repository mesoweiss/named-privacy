#This script is intended to freeze a domain or subdomain at a specific
#point in time. It was originally written for use with fetchmail with
#mail hosts like google that direct users to different clusters having
#different certificates (and thus cert fingerprints) based on apparent
#location. It's received very, very minimal testing since google and 
#other major providers became extremely tor-hostile shortly after
#its creation, so ymmv

#NOTE: you'll have to change these if you move the functions and config files
#      somewhere outside of the script's directory!
