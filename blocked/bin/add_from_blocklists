#This script is intended to automate importing new domain block entries 
#from easylist, easyprivacy, fanboy, et al. It works in theory, but
#the checking patterns could easily leave you with a broken named
#config with some unexpected list formats, so proceed with caution

#NOTE: you'll have to change these if you move the functions and config files
#      somewhere outside of the script's directory!
